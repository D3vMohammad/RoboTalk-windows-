**Text-to-Speech Program in Python**

This Python program utilizes the `pyttsx3` library to convert text input into speech, providing a simple and accessible way to generate spoken content. The program prompts the user to enter the desired text, which is then processed and vocalized using the text-to-speech engine.

**Instructions:**

1. **Installation:**
   Before running the program, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required `pyttsx3` library by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   pip install pyttsx3
   ```

2. **Running the Program:**
   - Save the provided Python script with a `.py` extension (e.g., `text_to_speech.py`).
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
   - Execute the script using the command:
     ```bash
     python text_to_speech.py
     ```
   - Enter the desired text when prompted, and the program will convert it into speech.

**Customization:**
   - The script can be easily customized to suit specific preferences or requirements.
   - Additional options provided by `pyttsx3`, such as adjusting speech rate, volume, or choosing a different voice, can be explored and implemented based on individual needs.

This program serves as a versatile and straightforward tool for converting text content into speech, with potential applications ranging from accessibility features to creative projects and automation tasks.
